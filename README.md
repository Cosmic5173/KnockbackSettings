# KnockbackSettings
This plugin allows you to change the default vanilla knockback to one of your choice. With this plugin you can change the horizontal and vertical axis, the attack delay, and player gravity. This is a very good tool for practice servers that have multiple different arenas in different worlds.

## Features
- [x] Per-World Knockback
- [x] Horizontal, Vertical, Attack Delay, and Gravity values.
- [x] Form to edit values.

## Usage
To set a worlds knockback, you must be **in** the world which you want to edit. To start the editing process run the command ``/kb`` (All commands must be run in-game). 

Next, if that world does not already have its own knockback, choose the ``create`` option, then you can proceed with editing the settings.

If the world does have its own knockback, you may choose the ``edit`` option.

*Note: All worlds start off with vanilla knockback until a custom instance is created.*
